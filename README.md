## The Story:

For a long time I've been using a variety of aliases for git commands, some of which were custom and aimed to boosting my git productivity - so I've decided to package it into a product for others to use.

## Main features:

1. Fast commits - add, commit & push, instantly.
2. Undo changes - cancel changes made to any file.
3. Branch hopping - move between branches, even if you have unstaged changes, without having to stage them.
4. Easy ignore - add files to ignore, sync with remote.
5. Interactivity - select and check instead of typing.

## Installation

With [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install igit
```
